						Let Sri Rama be your ideal. Ideals are remembered and adored
					for the purpose of adopting them in your own life. Lord Rama was the 
					prince of the Ikshvaku race. He was virtuous Lord of the mind and the senses. Brave and valiant, 
					and yet He was gentle and modest. He was a sage in counsel, kind and sweet in speech, and most 
					courteous and handsome in appearance. He was the master of the weapons, and a great warrior. Ever 
					devoted to the good and prosperity of His kingdom and His subjects, He was a defender of the 
					weak and the protector of the righteous. He was well versed in the science of the Self.
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="font-weight: 400;">
					One cannot be a real adorer of Lord Rama unless one makes an honest attempt to grow in the virtues 
					that the Lord represents. The Ramnavmi celebration or the Vasanta Navaratri every year is an 
					opportune period for us to saturate ourselves with the spirit of Lord Rama.
