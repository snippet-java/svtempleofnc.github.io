					<div ><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Supreme Lord is inseparable from the Sri Maha Lakshmi. She chooses to manifest herself in the divine Srivatsa (curl on Lord’s Chest), or in a single physical form (Sri Mahalakshmi or Padmavathi or Sita or Rukhmini etc) or as Bhu Devi (Andal) and Sri Devi in two forms or as Sri Devi / Bhu Devi / NiLa Devi (triple form) or even Ashta Lakshmi’s (eight forms).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divine Mother is intimately aware of the difficulties her children (we) face. She tries to help us with showering us with her ever enriching grace. Sometime we are too dull to fathom and realize the value of Supreme Lord Narayana, so she took form of And</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ā</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">l to show how the deities worship as per the agama rituals posses the power of the Lord himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lakshmi in Sanskrit is derived from its root form “lakSh,” which is synonymous with lak</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ṣ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ya, meaning aim or objective. Lakshmi is thus goddess of the means to achieving all four aims of human life namely dharma, artha, k</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ā</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ma and Moksha. Infact more than being a boon giver of both prosperity and happiness, she is the recommender of Moksha, to souls.&nbsp;</span></p></div>
