        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Supreme Lord is inseparable from the
            Sri Maha Lakshmi. She chooses to manifest herself in the divine
            Srivatsa (curl on Lord’s Chest), or in a single physical form (Sri
            Mahalakshmi or Padmavathi or Sita or Rukhmini etc) or as Bhu Devi
            (Andal) and Sri Devi in two forms or as Sri Devi / Bhu Devi / NiLa
            Devi (triple form) or even Ashta Lakshmi’s (eight forms).</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divine Mother is intimately aware of
            the difficulties her children (we) face. She tries to help us with
            showering us with her ever enriching grace. Sometime we are too dull
            to fathom and realize the value of Supreme Lord Narayana, so she
            took form of And</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ā</span><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">l
            to show how the deities worship as per the agama rituals posses the
            power of the Lord himself.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lakshmi in Sanskrit is derived from
            its root form “lakSh,” which is synonymous with lak</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ṣ</span><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">ya,
            meaning aim or objective. Lakshmi is thus goddess of the means to
            achieving all four aims of human life namely dharma, artha, k</span><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">ā</span><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">ma
            and Moksha. Infact more than being a boon giver of both prosperity
            and happiness, she is the recommender of Moksha, to souls.&nbsp;</span></p>
